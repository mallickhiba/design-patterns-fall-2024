# Design Patterns - Fall 2024

### Assignment 1
Define a number 'N' (you may hard-code this or dynamically ask for it from the user), which represents the number of objects to be created. Only create 'N' objects and reuse them as needed. Implement a system where objects are managed in a pool and a queue tracks the availability of each object. When an object is needed, it is requested from the pool, and once it is no longer in use, it is returned to the queue for reuse. Use any OOP language (no Python, Javascript or Go)
